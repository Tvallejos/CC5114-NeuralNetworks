1.Implement a genetic algorithm engine 
	1.Use the first version of the crossover (2 parents -> 1 child)
	2.Use the tournament selection algorithm	

2.Use it to solve the word finding example 
	
	1.Use it to find a simple word
	2.Use it to find a long sentence

3.Produce a hotmap to explore the performance space 
	1.Use of Matrix of configuration (population size, mutation rate)
	2.Mesure the number of generations to find the solution (or the fitness after X generations)
